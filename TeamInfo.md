## Project Summary

TuberInsights is a web platform designed to provide comprehensive insights for YouTube content creators. TuberInsights helps creators identify the best time to publish their videos by analyzing the correlation between view count and publish time. It provides valuable data on the optimal time of the day, date, and month for maximizing viewership. Additionally, TuberInsights enables creators to rank videos based on categories (tags), likes/dislikes, and regions. It offers insights into the total view count for each category and the like/dislike ratio for individual videos. Moreover, TuberInsights showcases the occurrence of tags in different countries and highlights the most popular video for each tag. With these functionalities, creators can make data-driven decisions, optimize their video publishing strategies, and enhance visibility and engagement.

TuberInsights offers a unique feature that visualizes videos as light data points on a world map within a specific time window. This visualization allows creators to observe global trends and predict the best publish time-based on the provided tags. Furthermore, TuberInsights employs advanced algorithms to predict the top trending tags for the next time slot, enabling creators to stay ahead of emerging trends and maintain a competitive edge. Additionally, the platform provides tag suggestions based on the video description, helping creators optimize their video metadata and reach a wider audience. With TuberInsights, YouTube content creators can unlock the full potential of their content, make informed decisions, and effectively engage their target audience.
